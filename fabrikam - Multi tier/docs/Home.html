<p><strong>Fabrikam Fiber sample application</strong><br>
<br>
This project provides download and support to anyone (i.e. trainers) who want to access the Fabrikam Fiber sample application, setup scripts, notes, etc.</p>
<p>This is the same sample project that you can find in the various versions of&nbsp;<a href="http://aka.ms/ALMVMs">Brian Keller's VM</a>. It was designed to be imperfect (i.e. contains bugs and surprises) allowing you to teach or tell a rich ALM story.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>Fabrikam Fiber is a fictional company that provides cable television and related services to the United States. They are growing rapidly and have embraced the latest Microsoft technologies in order to scale their customer-facing web site. This will allow
 the end users to create/manage tickets and track technicians in a self-service way.&nbsp;There is also an on-premises ASP.NET MVC application for their customer service representatives to administer customer&nbsp;orders.</p>
<p><strong>Sample Narrative</strong></p>
<p>You are part of the Development Team, which consists of 3-9 developers. They have decided to use Visual Studio and its ALM tools to plan and track their work, manage their source code, run their builds, and test their&nbsp;websites.</p>
